DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME:
The board is divided into two parts: player side and mancala,
and your opponent's side and mancala. Player 1 side is the six
holes closest to player1, and your mancala is to your right. The
same is for your opponent; their side is the six holes closest to
them and their mancala is to their right.To set up, place four
"stones" in each hole, excluding the mancalas. This should total
48 stones.During a turn, a player grabs all of the stones in a hole
on their side and drops them, one by one, in succeeding holes in
a counter-clockwise direction. Players mayplace stones in their
own mancala (it counts as a hole), but they must skip over their
opponent's mancala. Players may place stones in holes on their
opponent's side.If, when dropping stones in holes, you drop a
stone into your own mancala, and that is the last stone in your
hand, then you get to go again.
If, when dropping stones into holes, you drop a stone into a hole
that was previously empty, and the hole is on your side, and that
was the last stone in your hand, you take all of the stones in the
hole directly above, and place them into your mancala. This
continues until the player has no more stones in his hand. It is
then their opponents turn.The game is over when a player (not
both) has no more stones on his side. His opponent then takes all
of the stones on his side and places them in his mancala. The
winner is the person with the most stones in his mancala after
counting.
